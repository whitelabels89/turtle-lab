# Turtle Graphics Playground Project

## Overview
A web-based Python turtle graphics playground designed for kids to learn programming through interactive drawing and animation. Built with Flask backend and JavaScript frontend.

## Project Architecture

### Backend (Flask)
- **app.py**: Main Flask application with turtle code parser
- **main.py**: Application entry point for deployment
- **examples.py**: Sample turtle programs for educational use

### Frontend
- **templates/index.html**: Main interface with Bootstrap dark theme
- **static/js/turtle.js**: Canvas-based turtle graphics engine
- **static/js/editor.js**: Code editor with debugging console
- **static/css/style.css**: Custom styling and animations

### Key Features
- Interactive Python code editor with syntax highlighting
- Real-time turtle graphics animation on HTML5 canvas
- Function parsing and expansion for complex programs
- Debug console for tracking execution and errors
- Pre-built examples (Purple Star, Rainbow Square, Flower, etc.)
- Speed control and animation stopping capabilities
- Color picker and quick command buttons

## Recent Changes

### 2025-07-02: Coordinate System Fix and Fill Improvements
- **MAJOR FIX**: Fixed coordinate system to match Python turtle exactly
- Added comprehensive hex color support (#007B8A, #0099CC, #004D4D, #FFCC99)
- Fixed circle fill rendering - now draws solid filled circles immediately
- Created accurate "Cat Rocket" example matching original reference screenshot
- Improved begin_fill() and end_fill() functionality for complex shapes
- Enhanced color handling to set both pen and fill colors simultaneously
- Parser now properly converts function-based code to direct commands

### 2025-07-01: Turtle Shapes and Color Features
- Fixed loop parsing and execution - now properly handles for loops with start_loop/end_loop detection
- Added 5 different turtle shapes: turtle, arrow, circle, square, triangle
- Turtle now changes color based on color() command with enhanced visual design
- Added shape() command support in parser
- Created quick shape buttons in sidebar for easy shape switching
- Updated examples to be compatible with current parser (removed array indexing)
- Enhanced turtle graphics with eyes, shell patterns, and better proportions

### 2025-06-30: Enhanced Parser and Debug Features  
- Fixed error parsing variables in turtle commands (goto, circle, etc.)
- Added support for advanced turtle commands: dot(), setheading(), hideturtle(), showturtle()
- Implemented function definition parsing and expansion
- Added comprehensive debug console with timestamped logging
- Created stop button for animation control
- Successfully tested with complex rocket drawing code (238 commands)
- Added error handling for all numeric parameters with fallback values

### Deployment Configuration
- **render.yaml**: Render.com deployment configuration
- **requirements_render.txt**: Python dependencies for deployment
- **Procfile**: Process configuration for web services
- **runtime.txt**: Python version specification
- **.gitignore**: Git ignore rules for clean repository

## User Preferences
- Prefers Indonesian language for communication
- Interested in deployment to Render.com platform
- Values educational content for children
- Wants debugging capabilities and error visibility

## Technical Decisions
- Used fallback values (0, default colors) for variable parsing instead of complex evaluation
- Implemented function expansion rather than runtime interpretation
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging complex turtle programs
- Chose client-side animation over server-side rendering for responsiveness

## Deployment Status
Ready for Git push and Render deployment with all configuration files prepared.
